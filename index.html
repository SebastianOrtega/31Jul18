    <p>We absolutely love it when we see animal best friends hanging out together, and these adorable dog buddies are no different. We value dogs, as “man's best friend,” for the relationships they form with us, but they're social animals that are perfectly capable of finding friends among their own kind as well! Dogs evolved from wolves, and both animals have structured, pack-based social lives.
